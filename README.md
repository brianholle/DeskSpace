# DeskSpace

This is a small project that allows for cross collaboration on an image through changing individual pixels colors. This project was inspired by /r/Place. My goal was to have multiple users work together and make their own creation. This creation would then be set as the users background and updated in live time. Through this application, you can share a wallpaper with your friends, leave notes for eachother, or draw fun pictures!
